[Azure Cache for Redis](/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview) provides an in-memory data store based on the [Redis](https://redis.io/) software. Redis improves the performance and scalability of an application that uses backend data stores heavily. It's able to process large volumes of application requests by keeping frequently accessed data in the server memory, which can be written to and read from quickly. Redis brings a critical low-latency and high-throughput data storage solution to modern applications.

Azure Cache for Redis offers both the Redis open-source (OSS Redis) and a commercial product from Redis Inc. (Redis Enterprise) as a managed service. It provides secure and dedicated Redis server instances and full Redis API compatibility. Microsoft operates the service, hosted on Azure, and usable by any application within or outside of Azure.
