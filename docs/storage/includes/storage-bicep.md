#### Provisioning-generated Bicep

If you're new to [Bicep](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview), it's a domain-specific language for defining Azure resources. With .NET Aspire, you don't need to write Bicep by hand; instead, the provisioning APIs generate Bicep for you. When you publish your app, the generated Bicep is output alongside the manifest file. When you add an Azure Storage resource, the following Bicep is generated:

:::code language="bicep" source="../../snippets/azure/AppHost/storage.module.bicep":::

The preceding Bicep is a module that provisions an Azure Storage account resource. Additionally, role assignments are created for the Azure resource in a separate module:

:::code language="bicep" source="../../snippets/azure/AppHost/storage-roles.module.bicep":::

In addition to the storage account, it also provisions a blob container.

The following role assignments are added to the storage account to grant your application access. For more information, see the [built-in Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage).

| Role / ID | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Storage Blob Data Contributor<br/>`ba92f5b4-2d11-453d-a403-e96b0029c9fe` | Read, write, and delete Azure Storage containers and blobs. |
| Storage Table Data Contributor<br/>`0a9a7e1f-b9d0-4cc4-a60d-0319b160aaa3` | Read, write, and delete Azure Storage tables and entities. |
| Storage Queue Data Contributor<br/>`974c5e8b-45b9-4653-ba55-5f855dd0fb88` | Read, write, and delete Azure Storage queues and queue messages. |

The generated Bicep is a starting point and is influenced by changes to the provisioning infrastructure in C#. If you make customizations directly to the Bicep file, they'll be overwritten, so make changes through the C# provisioning APIs to ensure they're reflected in the generated files.

#### Customize provisioning infrastructure

All .NET Aspire Azure resources are subclasses of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureProvisioningResource> type. This type enables the customization of the generated Bicep by providing a fluent API to configure the Azure resourcesâ€”using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisioningResourceExtensions.ConfigureInfrastructure``1(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder{``0},System.Action{Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureResourceInfrastructure})> API. For example, you can configure the `kind`, `sku`, `properties`, and more. The following example demonstrates how to customize the Azure Storage resource:

:::code language="csharp" source="../../snippets/azure/AppHost/Program.ConfigureStorageInfra.cs" id="configure":::

The preceding code:

- Chains a call to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.AzureProvisioningResourceExtensions.ConfigureInfrastructure*> API:
  - The `infra` parameter is an instance of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AzureResourceInfrastructure> type.
  - The provisionable resources are retrieved by calling the <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Infrastructure.GetProvisionableResources> method.
  - The single <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Storage.StorageAccount> is retrieved.
  - The <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Storage.StorageAccount.AccessTier?displayProperty=nameWithType> is assigned to <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Storage.StorageAccountAccessTier.Cool?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
  - The <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Storage.StorageAccount.Sku?displayProperty=nameWithType> is assigned to a new <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Storage.StorageSku> with a `Name` of <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Storage.StorageSkuName.PremiumZrs>.
  - A tag is added to the storage account with a key of `ExampleKey` and a value of `Example value`.

There are many more configuration options available to customize the Azure Storage resource. For more information, see <xref:Azure.Provisioning.Storage>.
