# .NET Aspire PostgreSQL integration

[!INCLUDE [includes-hosting-and-client](../includes/includes-hosting-and-client.md)]

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with many years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. The .NET Aspire PostgreSQL integration provides a way to connect to existing PostgreSQL databases, or create new instances from .NET with the [`docker.io/library/postgres` container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).

## Hosting integration

[!INCLUDE [postgresql-app-host](includes/postgresql-app-host.md)]

### Hosting integration health checks

The PostgreSQL hosting integration automatically adds a health check for the PostgreSQL server resource. The health check verifies that the PostgreSQL server is running and that a connection can be established to it.

The hosting integration relies on the [ðŸ“¦ AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Npgsql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Npgsql) NuGet package.

## Client integration
